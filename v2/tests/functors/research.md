### 1. The "Symmetry Breaking" Phase Transition

- **The Claim:** Alignment isn't linear; it's a "crystallization" event.
- **The Experiment:** Plot `comp_sim` vs. training steps, but overlay the "entropy of the map." You should see a period of high-entropy "searching" followed by a sudden drop where the gauge "snaps" into place.
- **The Impact:** This frames consensus as a phase transition in a dynamical system, similar to how languages suddenly stabilize in a population.

### 2. Generalization to "Alien" Topologies

- **The Claim:** High-fidelity information can still be transferred between agents with different "resolutions" of reality.
- **The Experiment:** Align Actor A (8 basins) with Actor B (4 basins).
- **What to look for:** Does Actor A "collapse" its semantics to match B? Or does the functor learn a many-to-one mapping that preserves the maximum possible "shared" commitment topology? This would be a geometric model of **jargon-free communication** between an expert and a novice.

### 3. The "Commitment Failure" Cost Function

- **The Claim:** Shared symbols are a byproduct of the physical cost of non-coordination.
- **The Experiment:** Instead of supervising the distance, have the actors perform a joint physical task (e.g., moving a heavy object in a simulator). If their commitments don't align, the object drops.
- **The Result:** If the topology still aligns under these "naturalistic" conditions, you’ve proven that **semantics are a survival strategy for multi-agent systems.**

### 4. Algebraic Composition (The "Proto-Symbolic" Proof)

- **The Claim:** The latent space is not just a map; it is a _Functor_ in the category-theoretic sense.
- **The Test:** Test **Distributivity.** If an actor has two different actions and , does the map ?
- **The Impact:** If the map preserves the "addition" of commitments, you have moved from "A means B" to "Doing A and then B in my head is the same as you doing A and then B in yours." This is the foundation of **shared planning.**
